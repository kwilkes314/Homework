# Above-Average Code (Capstone Project Weeks 1-4)

## Definition Statement
I want to build an app that connects minorities, underrepresented people, and people who lack the financial means to fund their tech dream. With bootcamps, government programs, and private people and entities who need motivated tech individuals.

##Definition of Audience
Minorities, Underrepresented people in tech, People who can't afford college or bootcamps on their own.

## Elevator Pitch
Hi, my name is Kendall Wilkes. I am 27 years old. I have a 4-year-old son who makes me greater in every way. Tech, video games, and muay thai are some of my greatest loves. I chose Savvy because of their stellar reputation and also my early interaction with staff during the prework. I chose my capstone because I believe someone's out there trying to break into tech right now and I haven't created the website. The problem my capstone solves is that it helps non-traditional people to land roles in tech. This project was created using HTML CSS, JS.
