## Elevator Pitch
Hi, my name is Kendall Wilkes. I am 27 years old. I have a 4-year-old son who makes me greater in every way. Tech, video games, and muay thai are some of my greatest loves. I chose Savvy because of their stellar reputation and also my early interaction with staff during the prework. I chose my capstone because I believe someone's out there trying to break into tech right now and I haven't created the website. The problem my capstone solves is that it helps non-traditional people to land roles in tech. This project was created using HTML CSS, JS.
